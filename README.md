This project provides a tool to render battle maps of the most popular Westwood RTS games Red Alert 2 and Tiberian Sun, including their expansions Yuri's Revenge and Firestorm.

Status
------
The project has reached maturity and will know no big feature additions, but bugs might be fixed if reported. I am toying with the idea of building a webservice out of the tool, though, but that would probably appear under a different project.

Installation
------------
Installation should be as simple as running the installer or extracting the latest zip release. The NSIS installer cannot be used on non-Windows OS but the files inside the zip-archive run fine under Mono.
The program requires several .mix files from the original games. These include:

* ra2.mix
* language.mix
* theme.mix
(or their TS equivalents)

If the original game is installed under Microsoft Windows the location of these files will be found in the registry, but under Mono you have to specify their location on the command line.

The program depends on a software-only OpenGL renderer named Mesa. This approach was chosen to maximize compatibility on systems that have no window manager, such as on remote desktop sessions or on headless servers. This dependency is fulfilled on Windows by shipping the OpenGL32.dll and osmesa.dll files. On *nix systems the package _libosmesa-7.11.2_ or newer needs to be installed.

Usage
-----
Instructions on the command line application can be found by invoking `cncmaps -h`. Alternatively the CNCMaps GUI program can be used which contains descriptions of every option available and interactively updates the corresponding command line.

Development
-----------
Working on CNCMaps should be as easy as checking out the source. All dependencies, on Windows, are provided within the source tree. On Linux you need the libmesaos package which may be available through your package manager. Alternatively you can build it from http://www.mesa3d.org/download.html.

Older code repositories which contain a fully functional but not bug-free C++ version of this program can be found at 

* http://code.google.com/p/ccmaps (old)
* http://sf.net/projects/ccmaps (even older)

The project is no longer maintained at either of these locations.
